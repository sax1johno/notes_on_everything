# Notes on Everything

> To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.
> - Nicolaus Copernicus

Welcome to my notes on everything.  Well, almost everything.  As much as I can be bothered to take notes, anyway.  And I am a prolific note-taker - volumes of the handwritten decorate my office as I am a kinetic learner who learns by writing and drawing.

I hope that you find these notes useful, and I will do my best to keep them updated as new information renders certain information outdated, outmoded, or otherwise inaccurate.  I will do my best to keep the information in these notes opinion-free
